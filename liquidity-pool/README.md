# Soroban Liquidity Pool Dapp Example

This React demo project simulates a Liquidity Pool Dapp using Soroban smart contracts on Stellar.

Part of the code structure was done using [this repository](https://github.com/stellar/soroban-example-dapp) as inspiration.


Getting Started
===============

Install Dependencies
--------------------

1. `soroban-cli v0.8.0`. See https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/setup#install-the-soroban-cli
2. If you want to run the Soroban RPC locally: `docker` (you can run both Standalone and Futurenet backends with it)
3. `Node.js v16`
4. [Freighter Wallet](https://www.freighter.app/) â‰¥[v5.0.2](https://github.com/stellar/freighter/releases/tag/2.9.1). Or from the Firefox / Chrome extension store. Once installed, enable "Experimental Mode" in the settings (gear icon).


Run Backend
-----------

You have three options: 1. Deploy on [Futurenet](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/deploy-to-futurenet) using a remote [RPC](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/run-rpc) endpoint, 2. Run your own Futerenet RPC node with Docker and deploy to it, 3. run in [localnet/standalone](https://soroban.stellar.org/docs/getting-started/deploy-to-a-local-network) mode.

### Option 1: Deploy on Futurenet

0. Make sure you have soroban-cli installed, as explained above

1. Deploy the contracts and initialize them

       ./initialize.sh futurenet

   This will create a `token-admin` identity for you (`soroban config identity create token-admin`) and deploy two tokens to be used in the pool as well as the [liquidity pool contract](./contracts/src).

2. Select the Futurenet network in your Freighter browser extension

### Option 2: Run your own Futurenet node

1. Run the soroban-rpc locally using the Stellar Quickstart Docker image
```
docker run --rm -it \
   -p 8000:8000 \
   --name stellar \
   stellar/quickstart:soroban-dev@sha256:57e8ab498bfa14c65595fbb01cb94b1cdee9637ef2e6634e59d54f6958c05bdb \
   --futurenet \
   --enable-soroban-rpc
```

   **Note:** This can take up to 5 minutes to start syncing. You can tell it is
   working by visiting http://localhost:8000/, and look at the
   `ingest_latest_ledger`, field. If it is `0`, the quickstart image is not ready yet. 

3. Keep that running, then deploy the contracts and initialize them:

       ./initialize.sh futurenet http://localhost:8000

4. Add the Futurenet custom network in Freighter (Note, the out-of-the-box
   "Future Net" network in Freighter will not work with a local quickstart
   container, so we need to add our own):

   |   |   |
   |---|---|
   | Name | Futurenet Local RPC|
   | URL | http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc |
   | Passphrase | Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022 |
   | Allow HTTP connection | Enabled |
   | Switch to this network | Enabled |

5. Add some Futurenet network lumens to your Freighter wallet.

   Visit https://laboratory.stellar.org/#create-account, and follow the instructions to create your freighter account on Futurenet.

### Option 3: Localnet/Standalone

1. Run the soroban-rpc locally using the Stellar Quickstart Docker image
```
docker run --rm -it \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  --name stellar \
  stellar/quickstart:soroban-dev@sha256:57e8ab498bfa14c65595fbb01cb94b1cdee9637ef2e6634e59d54f6958c05bdb \
  --standalone \
  --enable-soroban-rpc
```

2. Keep that running, then deploy the contracts and initialize them:

       ./initialize.sh standalone

   **Note:** this state will be lost if the quickstart docker container is removed. You will need to re-run `./initialize.sh` every time you restart the container.

3. Add the Standalone custom network in Freighter

   |   |   |
   |---|---|
   | Name | Standalone |
   | URL | http://localhost:8000/soroban/rpc |
   | Passphrase | Standalone Network ; February 2017 |
   | Allow HTTP connection | Enabled |
   | Switch to this network | Enabled |

4. Add some Standalone network lumens to your Freighter wallet.

   1. Copy the address for your freighter wallet.
   2. Visit `http://localhost:8000/friendbot?addr=<your address>`


Frontend
--------

Now that you're running the backend, go to the `frontend` folder and run the development server:

    make start_dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
