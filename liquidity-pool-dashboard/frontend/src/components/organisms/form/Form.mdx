# Form

The proposal of `Form` component is help to build forms, and handle the form state

The `Form` component was implemented using [React hook form](https://react-hook-form.com/)

The form clones every `<Form.*>` component and injects the props that are necessary for react-hook-form.
Components with children that do not belong to `<Form.*>` will just be rendered normally.

> The motivation to not interact with all component tree to inject the form props, is to avoid performance issues in form rerender.

The form handles:

- Inputs state and form submit
- Form validation state and pass it to the `LabeledInput`
- Form field population

## Supported inputs

The form has the following supported inputs

### `Form.InputText`

The classic input text, with props:

<ArgTypes of={InputText} />

### `Form.Select`

A select input, with props:

<ArgTypes of={Select} />
